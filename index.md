C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp".
### Why C#:
C# is a modern object-oriented programming language that is portable and requires a .NET framework on a machine for it to run.

The performance of c# is exceptional in terms of speed and it can cheaply use resources.
Many applications can be created using C#. Some of these are given as follows:

- Web applications
- Networking applications
- Database applications
- Mobile application
- Games
- service applications 
- And so much more.


C# is a friendlier and easier language to understand for beginners.

To get started, we need:
- A working computer
- An IDE

The easiest way to get started with C# is to use an IDE. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit and compile code.
In our case, we shall use Visual Studio which we can download from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/.

Programs written in C# use the .NET Framework to run.
.NET Framework was developed by Microsoft and runs primarily on Windows operating systems. There is an open-source project as well â€“ it's called Mono. Mono delivers a cross-platform .NET Framework compatible set of tools (like runtime, C# compiler, etc.).

### C# Install
Once you have downloaded and installed the Visual Studio, choose the .NET workload and click on the *Modify/Install* button:
![vscode](netframework.png)

After the installation, click on the launcher icon to get started.
On the new window,choose *Create new project* :
![newproject](vs1.png)

On the click, choose *"Install more tools and features"* then click the Next button:

![newproject](Newproject2.png)

Choose *"Console App (.NET Core)"* from the list and click on the Next button:

![newproject](Consoleapp.png)

Enter the name you would like to call your project and click *Create*. In this case, I will call it *HelloWorld*:

![newproject](projectname.png)

The Visual Code will automatically generate some basic syntax of C# for you:

![newproject](Program.png)

Let's get started in coding.
Below is an example of the code that will be generated. It is a *Hello World* program.
```C#
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
class Program
{
static void Main(string[] args)
{
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
}
}
```

For you to run the program, you can press the *F5* button on your keyboard.
This will compile and run your code. A window console will pop:

```
Hello World!
C:\Users\Username\source\repos\HelloWorld\HelloWorld\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.0\HelloWorld.exe (process 13784) exited with code 0.
To automatically close the console when debugging stops, enable Tools->Options->Debugging->Automatically close the console when debugging stops.
Press any key to close this window . . .
```

### C# Syntax

From the above program, we created a *Hello World* program. Let's understand each line while making some changes:

```C#
//This is a C# program
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
class Program
{
static void Main(string[] args)
{
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
Console.ReadLine();
}
}
}
```
Here:

- Line 1: ```//This is a C# program```. 

The line starts with two forward slashes which makes it a comment. C# ignores the line when executing the code.
This is a single-line comment.

For multiple-line comment,we use ``` /* ```and ends with ```*/```.

Any text between ```/*``` and ```*/``` will be ignored by C#.

- Line 2:```using System```

In C#, it means that we can use the classes available in the system. It contains commonly-used types.


- Line 3: ```namespace HelloWorld{...}``` 

Namespaces are used in C# to organize and provide a level of separation of codes. It is a container that consists of classes, methods, and other namespaces.

- Line 4: ``` class Program{...}```

Class is a container that contains data and methods. 
Since C# is Object-oriented programming, creating a class is mandatory for each program. In our case, we are creating a class called Program.

- Line 5: ```static void Main(string[] args)```

Any program execution starts from the ```Main``` method.
Any code outside the main method will not be executed **unless** it is called.
Any program must have the ```Main``` method.

- Line 6 ```Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");```

```Console.WriteLine``` It is used to print out or output text on the console.
It prints a string and moves to the start of the next line.
In our case, it is used to output *Hello World*.

```Console. Write()```Prints a string in the same without moving to the next line.

- Line 7 ```Console.ReadLine();```

```Console.ReadLine()``` is used to read the next characters in the input system.
In the above program, as soon as the user enters anything and presses the ENTER key, it terminates.

```Console. Read()```is used to read the next character in the input system.

```Console.ReadKey()``` It obtains the next key pressed by the user. It is mostly used to hold the console for the user until he presses a key.

**Note**
- Each line ends with a semi-colon.
- C# follows a particular order when executing the program.
- C# is a case-sensitive language. Case sensitive language simply means that it treats lowercase and uppercase characters differently..e.g program and Program it's a different thing.



**Congratulations!** You just wrote your first C# program.

Let's dive into another program whereby a user will be able to input two numbers and get the sum of the two numbers.

```C#
//This is a C# program to add two numbers
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
class Program
{
static void Main(string[] args)
{
Console.WriteLine("Enter your first number: ");
int num1= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine("Enter your second number: ");
int num2= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine("Your Sum is "num1 + num2);//prints the sum of the two numbers 
Console.ReadLine();
}
}
}

```

Here's how your program will look like:

```C
Enter your first number: 2

Enter your second number: 5

Your Sum is 7
```

Let's discuss the new things in our program:

- ```int num1= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());```

```int num1``` This means that we are creating a memory location to hold an integer (int). In our case, we have named the integer **num1**. 

Just like integers, we have double data type which can store fractional numbers:
```C
double num1;
```

```Convert.ToInt()```
When we prompt the user to enter any details, C# takes the input as strings therefore, we have to convert the strings to numbers using the method above. 

```Console.ReadLine()``` accepts data from the user and allocates it to the memory location we had created earlier.

That's the basics of C#. The best way to kick-off this journey of C# is by practicing these basics from time to time.
